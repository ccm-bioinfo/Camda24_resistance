# Reto CAMDA 2024 - 2025: Anti-Microbial Resistance Prediction

Each year, the Community of Interest Critical Assessment of Massive Data Analysis (CAMDA) presents various challenges related to massive data analysis and life sciences data. One of this year's challenges addresses the problem of predicting antimicrobial resistance in isolated samples. We conducted different analyses of the data using methods such as pangenomes and RGI to obtain data frames with counts of similar genes in gene families and counts of AMR gene families.  We then applied various machine learning (ML) models: some to predict resistance-susceptibility and others to predict the amount of antibiotic needed to classify the sample. A wide variety of preprocess and dimensionality reduction methods, together with supervised and unsupervised ML models were used, yielding the best F1 scores ranging from 0.76 to 0.96, with the best result obtained with logistic regression with L1 regularization.
